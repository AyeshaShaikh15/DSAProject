# DSA Project: Shayan Qadri, Ayesha Shaikh, Aquib Ansari
The inspiration for this project was taken from our Enrollment that takes place every semester. 
The project will ask the user from a list of courses( a text file) and will allow them to add courses to their cart. The courses are DSSE courses including cs,ee and core courses.
The name of the text file is data.txt
We used quicksort algorithm from our DSA learnt techniques along with the use of classes for ease.
Other concepts used which was not taught in the course are: linkedlists.
references/videos we used for help.
